5</span>LITTLE ENGEL.</h2>
<p>It was the little Engel, he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So handsome was and gay;<br />
To Upland rode he on a tide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bore a maid away.</p>
<p>In ill hour he to Upland rode<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And made a maid his prize;<br />
The first night they together lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was down by Vesteryse.</p>
<p>It was the little Engel he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Awoke at black midnight,<br />
And straight begins his dream to state<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In terror and affright.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>&ldquo;Methought the wolf-whelp and his dam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The laidly she-wolf gray,<br />
Tore out my heart, and twixt their teeth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Did hold it as I lay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That thou dream&rsquo;st little Engel thus<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can cause slight wonderment,<br />
When me thou&rsquo;st ta&rsquo;en by might and main<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor asked my friends&rsquo; consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In came Solwey Johnsen then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stood before the table;<br />
He was I ween, a clever lad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And well to speak was able.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear thou, my lord, Little Engel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rise up and straight begone;<br />
For here Sir Godey Loumand comes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By four ways to the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear not four, Solwey Johnsen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor five fear I, nor ten!<br />
I fear not Godey Sir Loumand, though<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He come with thirty men.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;O there are more than four, Sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or five, Sir, or than ten;<br />
Here cometh Godey Sir Loumand with<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A hundred armed men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the little Engel, he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Took Malfred in his arm:<br />
&ldquo;Now, dearest heart, some counsel give<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; May free us from this harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the little Engel, her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the white cheek kiss&rsquo;d:<br />
&ldquo;Now do thou hear, my bosom&rsquo;s dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With counsel us assist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best advice that I can give<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give thee in this case;<br />
To Mary&rsquo;s Church we will retire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er destroy that place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll gold and silver take, and on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The scale we&rsquo;ll pile them high;<br />
To-morrow from the Churchmen we<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The holy place will buy.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;Around you call your merry men all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To whom you&rsquo;ve given bread;<br />
For refuge we to the Kirk will flee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we are thus bestead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you take all your merry men who<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your coursers&rsquo; backs have prest;<br />
We&rsquo;ll hie us to our Lady&rsquo;s church,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And set our hearts at rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best counsel, love, I know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A simple woman I;<br />
In Mary&rsquo;s house we&rsquo;ll lock ourselves,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And there our foes defy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the little Engel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the church he went:<br />
Sir Loumand to beleaguer him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A hundred men has sent.</p>
<p>Before the kirk his men they lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till full five months were past;<br />
It was Godey Sir Loumand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So wrathful grew at last.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Then spake the mother of little Malfred,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With hate &rsquo;gainst her was fill&rsquo;d:<br />
&ldquo;The Kirk of Maria burn with fire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And it with gold rebuild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire began to burn, to burn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sparkles in they flew;<br />
At that adread was little Malfred,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ashy pale she grew.</p>
<p>It was so hot in the Kirk yard when<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Abroad the blazes sped;<br />
But in the Kirk still hotter when<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In poured the melted lead.</p>
<p>It was the little Malfred,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So frantic was her mood:<br />
&ldquo;O let us quick the horses stick,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cool us with their blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then little Engel answer made,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As on the floor he stood:<br />
&ldquo;But coolness small shall we derive<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From our good coursers&rsquo; blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>Answered the groom who loved the steeds<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As dearly as his breath:<br />
&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;d better little Malfred stick,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She well deserveth death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the little Engel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His arms round Malfred twin&rsquo;d:<br />
&ldquo;No death hast thou deserved from us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And none from us shalt find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My little Malfred, do thou hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What I now say to thee;<br />
If a son this year thou chance to bear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That son name after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They placed her on a buckler,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They placed their spears below,<br />
And through the window lifted her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With hearts so full of woe.</p>
<p>It was the little Malfred round<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The church goes staggering now,<br />
Scorched were her scarlet robes, and scorched<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ringlets on her brow.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>It was the little Malfred fell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon her white bare knee:<br />
&ldquo;O may I bear a son this year,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The avenger of this to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they the little Malfred took<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in a mantle roll&rsquo;d,<br />
And sorrowfully lifted her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon a courser bold.</p>
<p>Outspake the little Malfred when<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She reached the verdant plain:<br />
&ldquo;Burnt is our Lady&rsquo;s house this day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And burnt so bold a swain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burnt is our Lady&rsquo;s house, and burnt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Therein so brave a swain;<br />
His equal till the day of doom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We ne&rsquo;er shall see again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It happened in the autumn tide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The autumn of that year,<br />
That she within her secret bower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A beauteous boy did bear.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>To the holy Kirk they carried him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They christened him at night;<br />
They called him little Engel, and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Concealed him whilst they might.</p>
<p>They fostered him for winter one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so on, till he grew<br />
The fairest knight beneath the sun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That you did ever view.</p>
<p>So well he grew and throve until<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seven years had passed away:<br />
&ldquo;Thy uncle slew thy sire, my boy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the first time, that I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still with his mother he remained<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till five more years were sped:<br />
&ldquo;Thy uncle slew thy father, boy,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He heard most often said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now do thou hear, my mother dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who sittest clad in pall;<br />
Up under Oe I&rsquo;ll riding go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And serve in the Monarch&rsquo;s hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>&ldquo;Yes, ride thee hence to Court, and there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To win thee honor try;<br />
Forget not who thy father slew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the last time I cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He served so long at court that he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His friend the Dane King made;<br />
With heavy heart he&rsquo;d sit apart<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst others laugh&rsquo;d and play&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>The Danish King observed at last<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He grieved at seasons all:<br />
&ldquo;Now hear, good youth, I&rsquo;d know forsooth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why thou art sorrow&rsquo;s thrall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou grievest like the little bird<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The greenwood bough upon;<br />
Thou seemest like the lonely wight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose friends are dead and gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now do thou hear, thou King of the Danes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With grief I down am weigh&rsquo;d;<br />
My uncle slew my sire of old,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And no atonement made.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;If thou wilt up of the country ride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And well avenge that deed,<br />
As many of my men to thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll lend, as thou shalt need.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou&rsquo;lt avenge thy father&rsquo;s death,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou shalt have fitting aid;<br />
Three hundred of my men to thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll lend, in steel array&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the little Engel, he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rides in the greenwood shade;<br />
He marshals there his good men all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sets him at their head.</p>
<p>In haste came in the little footboy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stood before the table;<br />
He was I ween a clever lad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And well to speak was able.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hear, Sir Godey Loumand, hear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Arise and straight begone;<br />
Little Engel&rsquo;s coming with his troop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By four ways to the town.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;Little Engel&rsquo;s coming with his troop,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he&rsquo;ll be on us soon;<br />
And wroth is he, as wroth can be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His war-lance scrapes the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Stevn and Ting, my boy, I&rsquo;ve been,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wherever people mingle;<br />
But ne&rsquo;er, I swear, have I been where<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard of little Engel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Godey Sir Loumand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He stroked the page&rsquo;s cheek;<br />
&ldquo;If thou canst give any good advice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My pretty footboy, speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can give any good advice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Most certainly I will;<br />
In your stone bower yourself immure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the approaching ill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The walls they are of marble stone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The doors they are of lead;<br />
&rsquo;Twill wondrous be, my lord, if we<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Therein are prisoners made.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>It was the little Engel, he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Halted a while to gaze:<br />
&ldquo;O there doth lie the Kirk, where died<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My sire in smoke and blaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there doth stand the castle, where<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My uncle doth reside;<br />
The amends that he shall pay this day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord in heaven decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By four ways they the bower beset,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And for admission call:<br />
The little Engel, sprightly elf,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was foremost of them all.</p>
<p>It was Godey Sir Loumand, through<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The casement out looked he:<br />
&ldquo;Now hark, ye knaves, bid your captain tell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why ye bawl so furiously?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then answered little Engel straight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath his mantle ruddy:<br />
&ldquo;Engel he&rsquo;s stiled, your sister&rsquo;s child,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I am he, Sir Godey.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>Then answered Godey Sir Loumand, he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was surely wroth thereat:<br />
&ldquo;Ride hence, and boast not of thy birth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou art a bastard brat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And though a bastard brat I be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My fortune&rsquo;s not the worse;<br />
Enough I hold of silver and gold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ride on a gallant horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if a bastard brat I be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou mad&rsquo;st me that I trow;<br />
But still I&rsquo;ve towers, and pleasant bowers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And of green woods enow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sire thou slew&rsquo;st, and no amends<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To me didst ever make;<br />
Now scoff thou hast upon me cast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For which thy life I&rsquo;ll take.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring gold, my merry men, and that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the threshold lay;<br />
We&rsquo;ll burn the bower this very hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We well for it can pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>&rsquo;Twas hot within the foreroom when<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fire began to roar;<br />
But hotter in the stone bower, when<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lead began to pour.</p>
<p>It was the little Engel, he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His courser never turned<br />
To ride away from the castelaye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the bower was burned.</p>
<p>Away at last he rode, and waved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His hand in exultation,<br />
Upon espying his uncle lying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Amidst the conflagration.</p>
<p>Said little Engel, when he saw<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His uncle&rsquo;s body shrink:<br />
&ldquo;Now thou hast quaffed the self same draught<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou mad&rsquo;st my father drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the little Engel, rode<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Home to his mother&rsquo;s hall;<br />
Before it stood his mother good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So fair arrayed in pall.</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&ldquo;Here dost thou stand, my mother dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Arrayed in robes of pall;<br />
I&rsquo;ve ridden up the land, and well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Avenged my father&rsquo;s fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the fair Dame Malfred, wrung<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hands and wept amain:<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d but one care before to bear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And now, alas, have twain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear mother, thou wouldst have it so,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now thee in tears I find,<br />
When duteously thy will I&rsquo;ve done:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How strange is woman&rsquo;s mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his steed and rode away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His face with anger red;<br />
With dishevelled hair, the Dame stood there,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such woeful tears she shed.</p>
<p>The little Engel hied him to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The King his master&rsquo;s court;<br />
Abroad the Dane King stood, and hailed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The youth in kindest sort.</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>Into the hall Sir Engel then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the good monarch went:<br />
&ldquo;My choicest thanks, thou noble King,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For thy brave warriors lent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve avenged my father&rsquo;s death,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Burnt is Sir Godey&rsquo;s bower;<br />
And he therein has found a tomb,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who slew my sire of yore.&rdquo;</p>

23</span>EPIGRAMS.<br />
<i>From the Persian</i>.</h2>
<h3>1.</h3>
<p>Hear what once the pigmy clever<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the stupid giant said:<br />
Things are not of highest value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which do highest rear their head;<br />
The sluggish horse is nothing better<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than the donkey lowest bred.</p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p>The man who of his words is sparing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His strength and weakness hidden keeps;<br />
Think not every thicket empty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Perchance in one a tiger sleeps.</p>
<h3><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>3.</h3>
<p>If thou would&rsquo;st ruin &rsquo;scape, and blackest woe,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto these words, these precious words attend:<br />
Never be heedless of a mortal foe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor choose a proud and envious man for friend.</p>
<h3>4.</h3>
<p>Sit down with your friends in delightful repose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When war and contention you see &rsquo;midst your
foes;<br />
But when to an end their contentions they bring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, then seize the bow, and get ready the
sling.</p>
<h3>5.</h3>
<p>The hungry hound upon the bone will pounce<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He prowling finds, and not mistrustful pass;<br />
He asks not whom it did belong to once,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The prophet&rsquo;s camel or the sinner&rsquo;s
ass.</p>
<h3><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>6.</h3>
<p>Great Aaroun is dead, and is nothing, the man<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who left forty castles replete with gold store;<br
/>
But living though dead is the great Nourshwan,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the good name he left he has death triumphed
o&rsquo;er.</p>
<h3>7.</h3>
<p>Though God provides our daily bread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet all must seek that bread I ween;<br />
Though all must die, there is no need<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To rush the dragon&rsquo;s jaws between.</p>
<h3>8.<br />
THE KING AND HIS FOLLOWERS.</h3>
<p>If in the boor&rsquo;s garden the King eats a pear,<br />
His servants rapacious the tree will uptear;<br />
For every five eggs he gives bounteously, more<br />
Than five hundred fowls will his armies devour.</p>
<h3><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>9.<br />
THE DEVOUT MAN AND THE TYRANT.</h3>
<p>If the half of a loaf the devout man receives,<br />
The half of that half to the wretched he gives;<br />
But no sooner a tyrant one kingdom has ta&rsquo;en,<br />
Than the wish of his heart is another to gain.</p>
<h3>10.<br />
THE CAT AND THE BEGGAR.</h3>
<p>If a cat could the power of flying enjoy,<br />
She all the world&rsquo;s sparrows would quickly destroy;<br />
If power in the hands of a beggar you place,<br />
No mercy he&rsquo;ll show to the beggarly race.</p>
<h3>11.<br />
THE KING AND TAYLOR.</h3>
<p>The taylor who travels in far foreign lands,<br />
Can always get bread by the work of his hands;<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
